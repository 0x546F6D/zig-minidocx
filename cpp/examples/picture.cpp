In China, the spring festival marks the beginning of the new year. It falls on \
the first day of the first month of the Chinese calendar and involves a variety \
of social practices to usher in the new year, pray for good fortune, celebrate \
family reunions and promote community harmony. This process of celebration is \
known as ‘guonian’ (crossing the year)."

In the days preceding the festival, people clean their homes, stock provisions \
and prepare food. On New Year’s Eve, families dine together and stay up late to \
welcome the new year. During the festival, people wear new clothes, make \
offerings to heaven, earth and ancestors, and extend greetings to elders, \
relatives, friends and neighbours. Public festivities are held by communities, \
cultural institutions, social groups and art troupes."
